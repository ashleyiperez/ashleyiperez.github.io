<div id="Adventures" class="tabcontent">
  <h3>Adventures</h3>
  <p>This is the Adventures section.<p> 
    <h4>Travel</h4>
    <p>I have spent time working in the travel and airline industry, and have found myself traveling through different areas of the United States and abroad more often. My travels have allowed me to gain perspective and learn about different regions, culture, and historical value in world travel. As I travel more, I learn more about the perspectives and diversity of people that are also travelers or who live further away from me.</p>
    <h4>Texas</h4>
    <p>I grew up in Texas. Physically and metaphorically. The cultures across Texas are different. South Texas has a large hispanic population with many Tex-Mex cultural influences. Central Texas has technology and mainstream cultures that are heavily influenced by the technology markets. North Texas is the aviation capital of Texas with an international airport hub to explore beyond. Living in Texas, I have met people from all types of backgrounds and have had the opportunity live in these different Texas based cultures.</p>
    <h4>New Mexico</h4>
    <p>I spent summers working in New Mexico. I hiked to Colorado, camped at the White Sand National Park during a red moon, toured national laboratories, and explored the historical sections of the state, including the Petroglyphs National Park. I learned how to live in the desert and how to prepare for long hikes while living in New Mexico. It is the land of enchantment, with unique culture, food, and people.</p>
    <h4>Pet Parenting</h4>
    <p>I have two cats and two dogs. They are all friendly and three of them are boys. Parneting animals requires discipline, routine, and responsibility. Taking care of another is one of the greatest honors we can have in life. Raising two cats and two dogs has been a large part of my life in becoming more responsible and perceiving life as fleeting and mindful that humans are not the only animals occupying Earth.</p>
    <h4>Aerospace/Aviation</h4>
    <p>I have worked in the aerospace/aviation space for a couple of years, learning how aircraft are made, and learning the applications of aircraft for life and leisure. Travel is an aspiration and a privelage for many. It was the Wright brothers work and inspirational words that inspired me to continue with my studies in engineering and apply these skills to the industry that allows for humans to live and visit all parts of the world.</p>
